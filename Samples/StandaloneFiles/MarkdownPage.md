# Hello World from Markdown

This is a **sample test page** using  *Markdown text* to render HTML. This page is a plain .md file rendered on disk and turned into HTML as part of the Live Reload server code.

Here's a code snippet:

```cs
int x = 10;
x++;
```

* List 1
* List 2
* List 3

This is really the behavior I'd like to see in markdown.
